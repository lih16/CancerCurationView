Cronjobs can fail! Monitor your important cronjob by pasting the following snippet at the end of the crontab entry. Make sure to replace the <placeholders> with your email address and some name for your cronjob.

 && curl -sm 30 k.wdt.io/<osman.siddiqui@sema4genomics.com>/<send-comments>?c=0_10_*_*_* /var/www/html/Development/tools/email_notify.sh 
  && curl -sm 30 k.wdt.io/<osman.siddiqui@sema4genomics.com>/<send-report-comments>?c=0_10_*_*_* /var/www/html/Development/tools/email_notify.sh

Should your cron job fail or not even start, you will receive an alert email.
